# dotfiles

In this rep you can take a look at all the dotfiles I have. Some are archlinux-specific, such as the keyboard configuration, others are more general, such as neovim and i3wm.

## i3

If you want to take a look at the Polybar config file, I recommend you see the one for i3. At the end, there are some related command lines.

## Keyboard

For keyboard tap-click, remember to install the driver xf86-input-libinput

## Nvim

Remember to install vim-plug, so you can install de plugins to the init.vim file.


## Polybar

Copy the original config file (created upon the polybar installation) from `/etc/polybar/config.ini` to `~/.config/polybar/config`.
Also, install yad for the pop-up calendar.
