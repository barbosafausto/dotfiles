# dotfiles

In this rep you can take a look at all the dotfiles I have.

## Keyboard

Good to point out that the file path is: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/


## Nvim

For nvim, remember to install vim-plug, so you can install de plugins to the init.vim file.

For keyboard tap-click, remember to install the driver xf86-input-libinput

## Polybar

Copy the original config file (created upon the polybar installation) from /etc/polybar/config.ini to ~/.config/polybar/config.
